# Design Decisions - ACTSERV Onboarding Platform

This document justifies key architectural choices for the dynamic form builder system.

---

## 1. Admin Form Configuration: JSON Schema Editor

**Decision:** JSON-based schema configuration in a textarea editor with real-time validation.

### Why This Approach?

**Flexibility:**

- Supports unlimited field types without UI constraints
- Complex validation rules (conditional requirements, file types, size limits) expressed declaratively
- No code deployment needed to add new forms

**Scalability for Unknown Needs:**

- Assessment states: "The company expects this platform to evolve and scale but they have no clear requirements on how many forms, fields, or rules they will need."
- JSON schema allows ANY field configuration without database migrations
- Adding new field types requires one switch case in FormRenderer - no backend changes

**Version Control:**

- Form definitions are text files that can be tracked in git
- Rollback to previous schema versions trivial
- Audit trail of all form changes

**Developer-Friendly:**

- Financial services firms employ technical admins who understand JSON
- Faster than clicking through UI builders for complex forms
- Copy-paste schemas between environments

### Why NOT Drag-and-Drop UI Builder?

**Time Constraints:**

- UI builder requires significant frontend complexity (drag handlers, field palette, live preview)
- Would take 2-3 days to build properly
- Assessment deadline doesn't allow this

**Limited Extensibility:**

- UI builders constrain what's possible to what's in the interface
- Complex validation rules (regex patterns, conditional logic) awkward in GUI
- JSON schema is infinitely extensible

**Over-Engineering:**

- For MVP with unknown requirements, simpler is better
- Can always add UI builder layer on top of JSON later

### Why NOT Pure API-First?

**Poor Admin UX:**

- Requires curl commands or Postman for form creation
- No visual feedback
- Error messages less intuitive

**Missing Validation:**

- API-only approach lacks real-time schema validation
- Admins discover errors only after POST request fails

### Implementation Details:

**Real-Time Validation:**

- Client-side JSON.parse() with try/catch
- Schema structure validation (required fields array, valid field types)
- Dropdown options validation
- Visual feedback (red/green borders, error messages)

**Example Templates:**

- Three pre-built schemas (Basic, KYC, Loan) loadable with one click
- Demonstrates best practices
- Reduces learning curve

## 2. Frontend Architecture: Schema-Driven Component Rendering

**Decision:** Single `FormRenderer` component that dynamically generates fields from JSON schema.

### Why This Approach?

**Single Source of Truth:**

- Form definition lives in database as JSON
- Frontend just interprets and renders
- No duplication of field definitions

**Maintainability:**

- One component handles all field types
- Adding new field type = one switch case
- Bug fixes apply to all forms instantly

**Type Safety:**

- TypeScript interfaces define schema structure
- Compile-time checks prevent invalid schemas
- IDE autocomplete for schema properties

### Component Architecture:

Schema (JSON)
→ FormRenderer (parser)
→ FieldInput components (text, number, date, dropdown, checkbox, file)
→ react-hook-form (validation)
→ FormData submission (with files)

**Benefits:**

- Reusable across all forms
- Built-in validation with react-hook-form
- File upload handling with size/type validation
- Conditional validation with watch()

## 3. Handling Edge Cases

The assessment specifies 7 edge cases. Here's how each is handled:

### 1. "Unknown and unbounded number of forms"

**Solution:** Dynamic routing `/forms/[slug]` + database-driven rendering

- No hardcoded form routes
- Infinite forms supported
- Add form via admin panel, instantly available

### 2. "Fields may evolve over time; new submissions must not break old ones"

**Solution:** `schema_version` field tracks changes

- Each submission stores schema version it used
- Old submissions reference their original schema
- Backwards compatibility guaranteed

### 3. "Some forms may require only 2-3 fields, others may require 20+"

**Solution:** Array-based field rendering

- `fields.map()` handles any array length
- No performance issues (tested with 50+ fields)
- Scrollable UI maintains usability

### 4. "Multiple file uploads per form may be required"

**Solution:** `<input type="file" multiple />`

- Each file field accepts multiple files
- Validation loops through all files (size, type checks)
- Backend receives array of files per field key

### 5. "Validation rules may differ (e.g., income proof only if loan amount > X)"

**Solution:** `conditional_required` schema property

```json
{
  "conditional_required": {
    "depends_on": "loan_amount",
    "operator": "gt",
    "value": 100000,
    "message": "Income proof required for loans above 100k"
  }
}

react-hook-form watch() monitors dependent fields
Real-time validation evaluation
Supports operators: gt, gte, lt, lte, eq, ne

6. "Two forms could have identical field names but different business meanings"
Solution: Field key is unique per form + submission isolation

Field key scoped to form schema
Submissions store form reference + responses
No naming conflicts possible

7. "Optional fields should not block submissions"
Solution: required: false default + react-hook-form validation

Only explicitly required fields validated
Empty optional fields allowed
Clear visual indicators (asterisks for required)


4. File Upload Strategy
Decision: Client-side validation + server-side verification with multiple file support.
Why Both Client and Server Validation?
Client-Side (UX):

Immediate feedback before upload
Prevents 5MB+ files from starting upload
File type checking (PDF, JPG, PNG, DOC, DOCX only)

Server-Side (Security):

Never trust client
Re-validate file types via MIME sniffing
Enforce storage limits
Prevent malicious uploads

Implementation:
Frontend:
typescriptvalidate: (files: FileList) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {
    if (file.size > 5MB) return "File too large";
    if (!ALLOWED_TYPES.includes(file.type)) return "Invalid type";
  }
}
Backend:

FileUpload model with foreign key to Submission
Files stored with file__<field_key> naming convention
Media storage configured for production cloud storage migration


5. Scalability for Unknown Future Needs
How System Scales:
New Form Type:

Admin creates JSON schema
Zero code changes
Form instantly available at /forms/new-slug

New Field Type (e.g., "signature pad"):

Add case to FormRenderer switch statement
Deploy frontend
All forms can now use signature fields

New Validation Rule (e.g., "regex pattern"):

Extend schema interface: validation: { pattern: string }
Add validation logic to FieldInput
Deploy once, available to all forms

New Operator for Conditional Logic:

Add to evaluateConditional function
Document in schema examples
No database migration needed

Database Design:
Forms Table:

schema (JSONB in production PostgreSQL)
Indexed for fast queries
Supports complex JSON queries

Submissions Table:

Generic responses JSONB field
Accepts any form structure
No ALTER TABLE for new fields

FileUploads Table:

Separate table for files
Linked via foreign key to submission
Scalable to cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure)


6. Technology Choices
Frontend: Next.js 15 + TypeScript

App Router for modern routing
Server Components ready for SSR optimization
TypeScript for type safety

Form Library: react-hook-form

Minimal re-renders (performance)
Built-in validation
Easy file handling

Styling: Tailwind CSS v4

Utility-first for rapid development
Responsive by default
Small production bundle

API Client: Axios

FormData support for file uploads
Request/response interceptors for auth
Better error handling than fetch


7. Production Readiness
Current (Development):

SQLite database
Local file storage
Console email backend

Production Migration Path:

PostgreSQL with JSONB indexing
AWS S3 / Azure Blob Storage
SendGrid / AWS SES for emails
Redis for Celery
Docker containerization

All designed into architecture from day one.

Summary
This architecture demonstrates pragmatic engineering:
✅ Meets all assessment requirements (dynamic forms, file uploads, async notifications)
✅ Handles all 7 edge cases explicitly
✅ Scales for unknown future needs (no code changes for new forms)
✅ Production-ready design (migration path documented)
✅ Justified choices (JSON editor, schema-driven rendering, client+server validation)
```
